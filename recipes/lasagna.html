		<p> This is a recipe stolen from allrecipes for their "World's Best Lasagna. I don't make Lasagna from scratch very often. This is because I think the quality gap between homemade and frozen lasagna isn't very large. </p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li> 1 pound sweet Italian sausage </li>
			<li> ¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
			<li> ½ cup minced onion</li>
			<li> 2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
			<li> 1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
			<li> 2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
			<li> 2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
			<li> ½ cup water</li>
			<li> 2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
			<li> 4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
			<li> 1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
			<li> 1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
			<li> 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
			<li> ½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
			<li> ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
			<li> 12 lasagna noodles</li>
			<li> 16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
			<li> 1 egg</li>
			<li> ¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
			<li> ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
		</ul>

			<li>Gather all your ingredients.</ul>
			<li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</ul>
			<li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</ul>
			<li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.

			<li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</ul>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</ul>
			<li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</ul>
			<li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
